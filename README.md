- **Notifications**: Receive alerts and notifications based on performance data.
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize performance metrics with interactive charts and graphs.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (or any other front-end framework/library)
- **State Management**: Redux (or any other state management tool)
- **Routing**: React Router (if applicable)
- **Build Tool**: Webpack (or any other build tool)
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library (or any other testing framework)
